OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECTS
Project: Python Programming
OBJECTIVES
The Objective of this Projects is to perform python programming on a dataset containing basic program data like addition,substraction,division etc.
The Aim is to cover the basic knowledge of  the python programming.
KEY ACTIVITIES 
Writing Code: Developing scripts and applications using Python syntax and libraries. This includes creating functions, classes, and modules.
Debugging: Identifying and fixing errors or bugs in the code. This can involve using debugging tools, reading error messages, and writing test cases.
Testing: Writing and executing tests to ensure the code works as expected. This can include unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like pytest or unittest
TECHOLOGIIES USED FOR PYTHON
Idle python 3.12.6 version tool
TASK 1  ANALYSIS:
1.Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2.Allow the user to choose an arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
3.Perform the chosen operation.
4.Display the result of the operation.

Function Definitions: Define separate functions for each arithmetic operation:

add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y, with error handling for division by zer
